                <p>Born into a family of 2 later turned 5, the first of 3 children from the union of a computer
                    programmer as a Father and an educationist as a Mother. As a child, my schedule on school days were
                    school, soccer, home (doing the dishes), assignment and sleep. I did the dishes, cleaned the house,
                    and ran errands to the market. I spent most of my free time playing games and soccer or watching my
                    favorite team Manchester United Play.
                    Despite how interesting my free time was, school was even more fun as I was always i the limelight
                    when it came to books. I don't particularly like books neither do I hate them, I just have the
                    ability to achieve what I want irrespective of whether I like it or not and that has been the
                    mindset since childhood. My parents always did their best to the best of their knowledge to provide
                    all I need and I'm grateful for that but of course that is the start.
                    My childhood memories are filled with fun as I was always joking, making friends, gaming, binging
                    cartoons and movies. I was fortunate to live with my parents surronded by uncles which gave me a
                    foundation on how adulthood would be. Fast forward few years later in senior secondary school about
                    crossing over to the University, there I was reading like it was the last time I would ever have to
                    read so I could get into my choice of course. Fortunately Here I am studying a course I probably
                    would have wisheed not to study few years back, but I'm grateful to God because He's been with me
                    evry step of the way.</p>

                <p>After missing the cut-off mark for my choiced course and finding my self in Computer Scienc
                    University of Ibadan, it's been tough and also easy. Tough in the sense that if you allow the
                    freedom to control you, you would find yourself out of the school in no time and its also easy if
                    yoou discipline yourself to balance the freedom and work involved.
                    From Lectures, to TDBs, to tutorials, Library (ps: never been to the library), to black-outs during
                    exam-time its been tough. I've had to meetup with deadlines for various projects at the same time
                    while still preparing for tests the same day and then impromptu classes early in the mornings or
                    late in the evenings. It's been tough and easy like i said but all glory to God, I'm still hear and
                    breathing fine.
